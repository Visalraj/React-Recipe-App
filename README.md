# React-Recipe-App
A React recipe app is a web application built using the React JavaScript library, designed to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience for discovering and managing recipes. Developed using the Spoonacular API, this app harnesses the power of the extensive culinary database to offer users a diverse range of recipes. With the integration of the Spoonacular API key in the required files, users can efficiently search for specific foods, accessing detailed information on ingredients and step-by-step instructions to cook each dish. This dynamic feature enhances the app's functionality, enabling users to explore and experiment with a variety of recipes tailored to their preferences.
